# Home service robot project 
## As shown the project main idea is to get target from specific place and put it into another place after creating map for undefined zone

## My steps:
1. adding both my gazebo world and turtlebot together 
2. starting to implementing slam and generating map through movening manually using turtlebot_key pkg and slam_gmaping pkg
3. moveing through the map in rviz using 2d navgoal tool and showing trajectory using navigation stack and Amcl algorithm
4. making cube markers which appear each 5 seconds using add_markers pkg
5. starting to pick and drop the markers seemingly after getting my odom and target position difference
